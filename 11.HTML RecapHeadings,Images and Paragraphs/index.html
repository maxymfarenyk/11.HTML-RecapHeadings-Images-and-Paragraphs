            <h3>5 Minutes Alone</h3>
            
        <hr>
        <p>I see you had your mind made up<br>You group of pitiful liars<br>
        Before I woke to face the day<br>
        Your master plan transpired<br>
        Something told me this job<br>
        Had more to meet the eye<br>
        My song is not believed?<br>
        My words — somewhat deceiving?<br>
        Now I’m unwhole<br>
        You’ve waged a war of nerves<br>
        But you can’t crush the kingdom<br>
        Can’t be what your idols are<br>
        Can’t leave the scar<br>
        You cry for compensation<br>
        I ask you please just give us Five minutes alone<br>
        Just give us Five minutes alone</p>
